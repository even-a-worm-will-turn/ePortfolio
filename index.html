<h3 id="improvement-strategy">Improvement Strategy</h3>
<p>I intend to add the following fixes to raise the functionality of the app:</p>
<p>Simplify the UI to make it more user-friendly and navigable for consumers of all technical proficiency.</p>
<p>Provide a simple text-based tool showing users their advancement toward their weight objectives (e.g., &quot;You are 5 lbs away from your goal&quot;).</p>
<p>Allow users to adjust when they get reminders to enter their weight, therefore improving the notifying mechanism.</p>
<h3 id="skills-displayed-">Skills displayed:</h3>

<h2 id="2-dog-search-and-rescue-identification-project">2. Dog Search-and-Rescue Identification Project</h2>
<p><strong> Category</strong> : Data structures and algorithms  </p>
<p><strong>Source</strong> : Course Project (Grazioso Salvare)</p>
<h3 id="project-commentary-">Project Commentary:</h3>
<p>Designed to assist a client (Grazioso Salvare) find appropriate canines from a database of shelter dogs for search-and-rescue training, this project To assist the client in making wise dog choices, the program sorts and filters canines depending on <strong>breed</strong>, <strong>age</strong>, and <strong>weight</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="enhancement-scheme-">Enhancement Scheme:</h3>
<p>I intend to: help the project to run better by:</p>
<p><strong>Optize the filtering algorithm</strong> to boost the accuracy and quickness in choosing appropriate canines.</p>
<p>Add <strong>error handling</strong> to guarantee flawless operation even in the case of unanticipated data or inputs lacking.</p>
<h3 id="skills-clearly-showed-">Skills Clearly Showed:</h3>
<p>Enhancing the efficiency of the choosing method is <strong>algorithm design and optimization</strong>.</p>
<p>Including steps to manage erroneous or absent inputs helps to <strong>error handling</strong>.</p>
<p>Creating a mechanism to rapidly and precisely sort through massive databases is <strong>data filtering</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="course-results-consistent-">Course Results Consistent:</h3>
<p>Using algorithmic ideas, design and assess computing solutions.</p>
<p>Optimize data handling and algorithm performance using well-founded approaches.</p>
<h1 id="flowchart-">flowchart:</h1>
<p>Start
   |
[Input dog data from the database]
   |
[For each dog, apply filtering criteria: age, breed, weight]
   |
[Sort remaining dogs based on suitability score (using existing criteria)]
   |
[Output filtered list of eligible dogs]

<h2 id="3-artemis-financial-secure-communication-project">3. Artemis Financial Secure Communication Project</h2>
<p><strong> Category</strong> : Design and Software Engineering and Database  </p>
<p><strong> Source</strong>: Course Project</p>
<h3 id="project-outlook-">Project Outlook:</h3>
<p>Working with <strong>Artemis Financial</strong>, this project refactorated their online application and included safe communication systems. By adding encryption, checksum checking, and switching from HTTP to HTTPS, the security of customer data and payment information was hoped to be enhanced.</p>
<h3 id="improvement-schedule-">Improvement Schedule:</h3>
<p>I&#39;ll highlight the following improvements:</p>
<p>Use an encryption method for safe data moves between servers and clients.</p>
<p>Provide a mechanism employing checksum technology to confirm the integrity of imported data.</p>
<p>Refactor the code to substitute HTTPS for HTTP such that every communication is safely encrypted.</p>
<h3 id="skills-showed-">Skills Showed:</h3>
<p>Using encryption techniques helps to protect data moves.</p>
<p>Ensuring all correspondence between the client and server is encrypted via HTTPS guarantees <strong>secure communication</strong>.</p>
<p>Confirming that data is not corrupted or altered during transport by means of checksum verification helps to <strong>data integrity</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="course-results-in-line">Course Results in Line</h3>
<p>Change your attitude to security and apply safe software programs.</p>
<p>Using industry-standard techniques will help to safeguard data and guarantee safe system connectivity.</p>
